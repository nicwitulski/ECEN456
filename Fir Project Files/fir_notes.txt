Notes for FIR Project requirements

- Filter comments:
	- Cutoff at 800 Hz
	- Blackman window used for small passband ripple with good stopband attenuation
	- Roughly -6 db in passband ripple
	- Lowest magnitude of -135 db in stopband
	- see Magnitude Response w/ values for visualization

- .dat file
	- See TVI.dat and TVIOut.dat for the intput and output of our filter. 
	  Use the matlab code, firParameters.m, to visualize comparison

- Reduce Cycles
	- Could not get intrinsic functions to reduce cycles, only increased them
	- Lowest amount = 177 cycles to run filter w/ C optimization at level 3 (all 240 samples)
	- Lowest amount w/o optimization: 2,547
	- FIR processing time = 2,547 cycles / 86 MHz = 29.62 us
	- Sample rate period = 1 / 24 kHz = 41.67 us
	- CPU usage % = (FIR processing time / sample rate period) * 100
		- (29.62us / 41.67us) * 100 = 71.08% of CPU Usage 
	- 71.08% of CPU usage. Most likely not real-time if logic to take in samples exceeds 29%.
	  - If this is the only process, then yes, the filter would be real-time.
	
- # cycles for 1 sample
	- No C Optimization:	2,547 cycles
	- Level 0:				1,907 cycles
	- Level 1:				1,902 cycles
	- Level 2:				180 cycles
	- Level 3:				177 cycles
	- FIR processing time = 177 cycles / 86 MHz = 2.06 us
	- Sample rate period = 1 / 24 kHz = 41.67 us
	- CPU usage % = (FIR processing time / sample rate period) * 100
		- (2.06us / 41.67us) * 100 = 4.94% of CPU Usage 
	- Only 4.94% of CPU usage, so YES, real-time!

- Equation:
	- At order 59 = 177 cycles
	- At order 119 = 300 cycles
	- At order 239 = 540 cycles
		- From this, an equation can be found to be:
		- Cycles = 2.02(Order + 1) + 54
			- Test at order 269. Per Eq, should be around 599 cycles
			- Order 269 actual = 597

- See graphs. The expected vs actual graphs are very close. From the difference signal,
  you can see there is a little variation, but the MSE is at 8.798453e-05.
  
- Delay: (240 samples * 177 cycles) / 86 MHz = 0.494 ms
